Receipt and Warranty Mobile Manager
By Mohammad, Kai, Dennis and Jason.

Have you ever gone to a store, asked for a receipt, and taken it? Now let me ask you this: what did you end up doing with that receipt? The right thing to do is to keep it in a safe place for later use. However, most of us tend to lose it, throw it away, or even forget to ask for it in the first place. It’s easy to think that a piece of paper has no value until the moment we desperately need it and don’t have it. Receipt and Warranty Mobile Manager (RWMM) solves this problem by helping you manage every receipt you obtain. Simply scan your receipt, and it will be stored in the application’s cloud database, automatically logging all your purchases. The app can save your receipts as logs and images, provide financial insights into your spending habits, and notify you about warranty deadlines and information.
